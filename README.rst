Introduction
============

A header library that aids in the parsing of binary protocols.  This
library uses C++11 features, so its usage requires a compliant C++11
compiler.

Building
========

protocol-helper is a header library, so it doesn't require any
building to use; however, the examples are built with CMake.  The
examples can be built by issuing the following commands at the top of
the build tree::

 mkdir build-dir
 cd build-dir
 cmake ..
 make
